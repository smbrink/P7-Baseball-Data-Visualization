# P7-Baseball-Data-Visualization

Summary,
I choose the baseball data set to use in my visualization because I am very interested in baseball as a game as well as the  stats behind it. I am going to analyze the data to show the correlation of homeruns and batting average to the height and weight of a baseball player. The dataset includes the name, handedness, height, weight, batting average (avg), and home run totals (HR) of 891 baseball players. I removed the players with a batting average of 0.00 (267 players) due to the fact they probably never actually played in a major league game. 

The data clearly shows a noticable correlation in the average amount of homeruns with the height and weight of the baseball players. It seems the taller and/or heavier a player is the more home runs they are likely to hit. The batting average of the players are pretty comparable with the height and weight of the players. It showed no real correlation in the height and/or weight of a player.


Design,
I choose to show scatter/line plots to visualize the correlation in batting average and home run totals due to the height and weight of the given baseball players. I decided to use buttons to switch between the plots so the audience could control what plot they were seeing.
