# P7-Baseball-Data-Visualization

I choose the baseball data set to use in my visualization because I am very interested in baseball as a game as well as the  stats behind it. I am going to analyze the data to show the difference in homeruns and batting average compared to the height and weight of a baseball player. The data clearly shows a noticable difference in the average amount of homeruns with the height and weight of the baseball players. The batting average of the players are pretty comparable with the height and weight of the players.
