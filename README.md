# P7-Baseball-Data-Visualization

Summary

I choose the baseball data set to use in my visualization because I am very interested in baseball as a game as well as the  stats behind it. I am going to analyze the data to show the correlation of homeruns and batting average to the height and weight of a baseball player. The dataset includes the name, handedness, height, weight, batting average (avg), and home run totals (HR) of 891 baseball players. I removed the players with a batting average of 0.00 (267 players) due to the fact they probably never actually played in a major league game. 

The data clearly shows a noticable correlation in the average amount of homeruns with the height and weight of the baseball players. It seems the taller and/or heavier a player is the more home runs they are likely to hit. The batting average of the players are pretty comparable with the height and weight of the players. It showed no real correlation in the height and/or weight of a player.


Design

I choose to show scatter/line plots to visualize the correlation in batting average and home run totals due to the height and weight of the given baseball players. I decided to use buttons to switch between the plots so the audience could control what plot they were seeing.

I created a data set with weight_bin to put all the different weights in to help declutter the weight x axis. It really helped smooth out the chart and also made it look alot cleaner.


Feedback 

1. My Wife-It was suggested that I correct some language and spelling in my final project as well as make the chart container a little smaller to keep the buttons from over lapping the x axis title in my bl.ocks.org example.

2. Forum member Georgeliu gave me some very positive feedback including...
Perfect chert type with a clear explaination.
No clutter and the right color as not to distract but enough to make it distinct.
Individual titles do a good job of explaining the insights of the charts.

3. Another unnamed forum member gave me a some more feedback including...
Add player weight into intervals using bins as to make the x axis less cluttered. Done and it helped out alot.
Add general homerun average line to help with the comparison between each datapoint. I didn't feel it was needed because the comparsion I was trying to draw was between the different heights and weights and not necessarily the players as a whole.

Resources

I used an assortment of resources including the Udacity Forum, Stackoverflow, Wikipedia, D3 API, dimple, and Google.
