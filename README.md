# P7-Baseball-Data-Visualization

I choose the baseball data set to use in my visualization because I am very interested in baseball as a game as well as the  stats behind it. I am going to analyze the data to show the difference in homeruns and batting average compared to the height and weight of a baseball player. The dataset includes the name, handedness, height, weight, batting average (avg), and home run totals (HR) of 891 baseball players. I removed the players with a batting average of 0.00 (267 players) due to the fact they probably never actually played in a major league game. 

The data clearly shows a noticable difference in the average amount of homeruns with the height and weight of the baseball players. It seems the taller and/or heavier a player is the more home runs they are likely to hit. The batting average of the players are pretty comparable with the height and weight of the players. It showed no real advantage in the height or weight of a player.
